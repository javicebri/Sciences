Science/math projects and tools

The projects are organized by thematic folder.
My_tools folder contains my generic functions so I can use them when I need them.

- Pi_day: estimation of pi value with random points.

- My_tools/distanceHaversine.py: calculate the distance between two points over a sphere with the latitude and longitude.
